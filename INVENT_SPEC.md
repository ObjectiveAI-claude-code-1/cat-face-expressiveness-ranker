Rank cat pictures by the expressiveness of the cat's face. Examine the cat's eyes for emotional states — the slow half-lidded droop of deep relaxation, the wide black-pupil stare of overstimulation, the hard unblinking focus of a cat tracking prey, or the soft squint of feline affection. Read the ears for signals: ears pricked forward for curiosity or alertness, ears flattened sideways ("airplane ears") for irritation or anxiety, ears pinned fully back for fear or aggression. Note whether the mouth and whiskers add expressiveness — a mid-yawn, a mid-meow, or whiskers fanned forward in engagement. Rank images high when the cat's face is clearly communicating a readable feeling such as contentment, rage, bewilderment, or imperial disdain. Rank images low when the face is neutral, closed, or offering the generic resting expression of a cat that is neither particularly engaged nor particularly bothered. The central question is whether the face is actively transmitting an inner state or is simply present.
