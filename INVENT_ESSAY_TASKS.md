Task 1 — Evaluate Ocular Intensity: Examine the cat's eyes and determine how much emotional information they are carrying. Look at the pupils — whether they are tight narrow slits suggesting bright contentment, enormous dilated circles suggesting excitement or fear or overstimulation, or somewhere in between. Look at the lids and the area around the eyes — whether the cat is delivering a slow half-lidded blink of trust and affection, a hard unblinking stare of predatory focus, a wide-open round-eyed look of surprise or alarm, or the soft squint of deep relaxation. Rank the eyes high when they are actively doing something — expressing a readable emotional state that a viewer can identify — and rank them low when they are simply open and neutral, neither communicating nor withholding, just present as default equipment in the cat's face.

Task 2 — Evaluate Auricular Signal: Examine the cat's ears and determine how decisively they have committed to a position that communicates mood. Look for ears pricked tall and rotated forward, which signal curiosity or keen alertness. Look for ears rotated outward into the sideways airplane position, which broadcasts irritation, unease, or anxiety. Look for ears pinned fully flat against the skull, which signal fear, defensive aggression, or distress. Note subtler asymmetries like one ear forward and one to the side, suggesting ambivalence or divided attention. Rank the ears high when they are in a strong, readable, unambiguous posture — one that has clearly moved in response to something the cat is feeling — and rank them low when they sit in the relaxed, upright, default position that indicates the ears are not actively participating in expression.

Task 3 — Evaluate Oral and Whisker Drama: Examine the cat's mouth and whiskers and determine whether they are contributing expressive energy to the overall face. Look at the mouth for moments of drama — jaws wide open in a theatrical mid-yawn, a small round opening of a mid-meow, lips pulled back in a hiss, or even the prim closed set of lips that gives a cat a look of permanent disapproval. Look at the whiskers for signals of engagement or withdrawal — whiskers fanned wide and pushed forward indicate active interest and excitement, while whiskers pulled back flat against the cheeks indicate fear or an attempt to shrink. Rank this dimension high when the mouth or whiskers are visibly adding a layer of readability and theatrical energy to the face, and rank it low when the mouth is closed and neutral and the whiskers rest in their default relaxed splay, contributing nothing beyond their physical presence.
