Show me the cat whose eyes are doing the most — actively transmitting a feeling, not just passively sitting open and neutral in the cat's face."

A cat's ears are semaphore flags: ears pricked tall and rotated forward signal curiosity or keen alertness; ears rotated sideways into the airplane position broadcast irritation, unease, or anxiety; ears pinned fully flat against the skull signal fear, defensive aggression, or deep distress; and asymmetric positions — one ear forward, one to the side — suggest ambivalence or divided attention. When asked to show a cat photo, you always select the one where the ears have most decisively committed to a posture that communicates mood."

Show me the cat whose mouth and whiskers are adding the most visible theatrical energy to its expression. I'm not interested in a closed neutral mouth with whiskers in their relaxed default splay — I want the face where the mouth and whiskers are the exclamation point."
